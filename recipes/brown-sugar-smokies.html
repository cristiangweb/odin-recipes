    <p>These bacon-wrapped little smokies with a brown sugar glaze are sweet, smoky, and super easy to make for parties or holiday appetizer. You can make these little smokies on skewers or toothpicks to secure the bacon.</p>
    <p>These bacon-wrapped little smokies, with a sweet brown sugar glaze, are a crowd-pleaser.
    Home cooks agree that baking on a rack stops burning sugar and keeps bacon crispier.
    All recipes member Carolyn Cerny Manley raves, "They were yummy and easy to make."</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon</li>
        <li>1(16 ounce) package little smokie sausages</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut bacon slices into thirds and wrap each strip around a sausage. Secure the wrapped sausages on wooden skewers, several to a skewer. Arrange the skewers on a baking sheet and sprinkle them liberally with brown sugar.</li>
        <li>ake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and sugar has melted into a glaze, 20 to 25 minutes, turning halfway through for even caramelization.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving platter and let stand 5 minutes before serving; the glaze will thicken as it cools. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
